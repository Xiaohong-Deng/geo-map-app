# Geo Search with Geocoder and Elastic Search

## Branches
- master: search with Geocoder
- elastic-search: search with Elastic Search and SearchKick. Need to install and start a separate Elastic Search instance to be able to use ES in your Rails app. Very much like the case with postgresql. Check [SearchKick](https://github.com/ankane/searchkick) for detail
